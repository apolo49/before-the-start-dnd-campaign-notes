# Limitations on Player Characters
## Languages
Player Characters are not allowed to be fully proficient in [[Solari (Language)|Solari]], but they are allowed to understand it. They are also not allowed to understand the following languages, though exceptions may apply:
- [[Aeikas]],
- [[Ebibu]],
- [[Ek]]
## Cultures
Player Characters are not allowed to be [[Solari (Culture)|Solari]], [[Qatha]], [[Aeia]], or [[Kufa]]. Players are encouraged to be of a [[Freiburg]] culture.
## Race
Due to race politics in [[Solara]] the player characters are allowed to be whatever race they want, but they have to be humanoid and have to have a good disguise to make them appear human at all times. Elves, dwarves and halflings do not have this limitation but may be seen as lesser and an oddity.
## Elements
All players will be assigned an element at random. They are aware of their powers and which powers they have, but not which one others players have. [[Elements]] and [[Elementals|elementals]] are outlawed in Solara, there is also rampant propaganda, and players are aware of this. All magic is also outlawed in Solara unless a person has a [[License to use Magic|magic license]].
