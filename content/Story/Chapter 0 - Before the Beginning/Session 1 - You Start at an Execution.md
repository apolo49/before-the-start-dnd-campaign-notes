# Premise
The party are scattered throughout the crowd, watching the execution of the captured elementals from the future before them. They can see drops of water come from [[Kraven Redblade|Kraven]]; mounds of solid ground try to keep [[Lyre Hallowstream|Lyre's]] feet in place; chains rattling and having a mind of their own near [[Bronlyl Battleale|Bronlyl]]; guards begin to cry near [[Alea]]; chains freeze near [[Derf Drayniw|Derf]]; all is seen as they are taken out one by one, but none has the power to escape. Slowly the executioner approaches and shouts loudly to the crowd:
>	These scum have been captured by the 20th [[Rikati]] of the Great Nation of [[Solara]] for arriving within our lands illegally without documentation and causing unrest and danger to our people by being [[Elementals]] of great power and using this power to attempt to destroy the 20th Rikati.

The crowd cheers and is elated by the news. They proceed to shout all sorts of obscenities and curses at the prisoners. The executioner beheads them one-by-one taking his time to take in the cheers of the crowd between each and every one.

Eventually the execution ends with the execution of [[Aelius]], unlike the rest, there was nothing that stood out about him from the rest of the people in the crowd and nothing spectacular happened. There were no cheers when he was executed, but instead just silence.

An hour passes and the square outside the [[Forum Solaunao]] and beneath the [[Obelisk of Origin]] clears. It turns back to the way it is on a normal day and all who are left are the main party.
