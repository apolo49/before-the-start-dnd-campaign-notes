title: Before the Start
---
"Before the Start" is a Dungeons and Dragons campaign made by Joe Targett for his group of friends who play DnD together. This is intended to expand on the world that Tegan had created in her homebrew campaign and offer a new enjoyable experience while retaining a similar setting and lore.

Before the Start offers new expansive lore in a world much more expansive than it seems with hundreds of years of detailed history, interactive maps and journey planners and much more!
