# Premise
Players bring their former characters from Tegan's campaign and then get transported to the past after the battle. They land on the last day of [[Solari Calendar|Shumi]] (The last month of the year) 697 [[Setting/Semantics/Dating/index|IOG]]. Everything is unrecognisable to them. The 20th [[Military of Solara|Rikati]] of [[Solara]] shows up and demands they show their identification as they don't have any they are forced to fight, revealing that they are [[Elementals]], which leads to their capture.

This then leads to them being brought to [[Solaum]] and executed on the spot (all except [[Aelius]] as he has ties to Solara). In the crowd watching their execution is their new player characters (not yet created).

# Story
The party celebrates the end of the struggle they had been facing for countless days, adventuring across the lands of the [[Stormshroud Legion]]. As they begin to celebrate, [[Decimus]], one of the members of the [[Solaris Vanguard]] (the secret society emulating the practices of the old nation of [[Solara]]), tells them stories of the forgotten nation, in which [[Aelius]] happily divulges. They then retreat to their chambers to sleep.

They awake to see the camp deserted. This desertion is not typical of The Solaris Vanguard, as it is not a part of the virtue of hospitality honoured by the nation of Solara, thusly Aelius is shocked. On the floor is a circle of the [[Elements]], a symbol distrusted by the [[Solari (Culture)|Solari]] as recounted by Aelius.

The party proceeds to stand in their places, [[Thandoril Sunfire|Thandoril]] follows suit. Once this happens the circle begins to emanate a strange light and the sun begins to be eclipsed by the moon. A beam of light envelops the elementals and the [[Third Convergence]] takes place, sending the party back in time to just before the [[Second Convergence]].

The party awakes from unconsciousness. Dazed and confused, the party is left to wonder as to what just happened, thusly, they begin looking for answers; the circle beneath their feet has disappeared and appears to have been swallowed with grass and dirt. Their surroundings have suffered the same fate. A land that was once a camp of the Solaris Vanguard seems to have become dense forest. Upon further observation, it seems the [[Great Tent]] has also vanished following the preceding events. After a great search, they can see smoke rise above the canopy in the distance to the North. The party now has their heading.

Heading this way brings them to a relatively modern looking path in the forest. The wood has clearly been artificially cleared to make way for the cobblestone road. A road this maintained must be kept in this state by a powerful entity. They continue to follow the road towards the smoke to look for answers. This road is the best road they had walked on for a long time as it is made for heavy use.

As they continue their walk, they see a marching [[Military of Solara|rikati]] coming into view with great fires and a massive supply chain in tow. The amount of soldiers numbers in the thousands. Upon seeing the adventurers the scouts of the rikati report back to the [[Centurion]]. The centurion sends an envoy ahead to greet the travellers and asks for documentation of their residence within Solara.

The envoys speaks in a [[Solari (Language)|language the party cannot understand]], except for complex vocabulary. All except Aelius who can understand the language to a basic degree. Despite this he cannot respond, he can only understand the words spoken at him. They attempt to explain that they do not have any documentation in [[Common (Language)|Common]]. This effort was not founded though and the envoy just wanders back to the rikati and informs the Centurion of the transgression and their strange language. The rikati continues its march along the path, encountering the party, attacking them unawares and capturing them for being [[Elementals]].

The rikati continues its march following the capture of their new powerful prisoners, having handcuffed them using [[Elemental Suppression Cuffs|elemental suppression cuffs]] to prevent them from using their powers. Eventually the party arrives at the [[Camp of the 20th Rikati of Solara]], near [[Ducata]]. Here the Centurion questions the party of their intentions, but cannot get a word out of them. Not liking the lack of co-operation from the party, the rikati boxes them up to be shipped to the capital of Solara, [[Solaum]].

During their travels, the party can hear lots of conversations; the sound of a horse's gallop; the onloading of their containers onto a ship; the sounds of the sea for hours; the offloading of their containers and then the sounds of a bustling city. Throughout their journey they cannot see any of the events taking place.

Suddenly, the crates open up to reveal a detention centre and another soldier of a rikati. He is carrying chains that he ties around the wrists and ankles of the prisoners, including the party. He then leads the prisoners out to the execution grounds in front of the [[Forum Solaunao]] and the [[Obelisk of Origin]].

The great crowd around the prisoners watch in anticipation as the executioner slowly moves up the line with his axe, beheading each and every one of the prisoners. The excitement draws to a peak as the executioner announces to the crowd that the following prisoners have all been captured for being illegal, dangerous elementals. To which the crowd cheer in excitement to their impending death. The executioner swings his axe and beheads each one-by-one until the last party member is dead.

The screen turns black.
