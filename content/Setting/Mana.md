# Lore
Mana is a form of lifeforce like energy that allows a living being to use magic. The strength of one mana can be increased through practice and is intrinsically tied to affinity to the elements, therefore elementals have more mana than other beings.

It is believed mana was bestowed upon living beings before [[The Convergence]] by the gods when life was first created. Once a creature's mana is exhausted they begin to feel tired and may even become immobile or faint until it is recovered through rest or other means.
