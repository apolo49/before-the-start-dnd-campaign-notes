The Elements are the ultimate form of magic and do not involve abusing the mana in natural things to force magic to come to being as many do with their magic. Elemental magic is the natural state of magic.

Elemental magic was more common across the world before the Convergence. Every now and then people from powerful magical lines are born with the natural gift of the elements and elemental magic.
