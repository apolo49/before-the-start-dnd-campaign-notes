As per dating the real world, wherein an arbitrary number is chosen as 0 and we can go back and forth, the dating in this world is the same, however our dating *primary* dating system is called "From the founding of the city" which refers to the founding of the city of [[Solaum]], the capital of [[Solara]].

- The founding year is year 0 IOG
- The year before the founding is year 1 BOG
- The year after the founding is 1 IOG
In [[Solari (Language)]], this is called "Ip Osurbaiko Gumdit." This is abbreviated to IOG. For dating before the founding use "Bri Osurbaiko Gumdit."

Other cultures have other dating systems, the length of the year is equivalent in each, making conversion easy.
Other systems include:

- [[Soa Dating System]]
- [[Eceh Royal Calendar]]
- [[Aeia Foundation Calendar]]
- [[Qatha Calendar]]
- [[Makonda Calendar]]

[[Freiburg]] and [[Dulegan]] cultures have no dating systems or calendars.

The starting date of the campaign is 698 IOG.

The next conversation starts during 700 IOG.

# Aeia Foundation Calendar

*Main Article: [[Aeia Foundation Calendar]]*

The Aeia Foundation Calendar is an integral part of [[Aeia]] Culture and all cultures descended from it maintain this calendar.

The Aeia believe this calendar marks the date of the start of humankind and their habitation of the planet. In reality it marks the date of [[The Convergence]] wherein most magical life was eradicated from the planet, and life was given the power of [[Elements|the elements]].

Every 5000 years on the Aeia calendar marks another convergence. This is 2 years from the campaign start date.

# Qatha Calendar

*Main Article: [[Qatha Calendar]]*

The Qatha Calendar marks the start of [[Qatha]] civilisation in [[Ebibu]]. This calendar is a calendar of cycles and yearly increments. Each cycle is a 12 year period. On cycle 300 the calendar has a mark in a long lost script.

The Qatha Calendar cannot count backwards.

The common format for Qatha Calendar is *N*C*-*N*Y such as 1C-0Y or 241C-8Y.

# Eceh Royal Calendar

*Main Article: [[Eceh Royal Calendar]]*

The Eceh Royal Calendar was created to be rid of the limitations of the Qatha Calendar. It was created at the start of the 50th Cycle making them exactly 600 years removed from each-other.

# Solari Calendar

The Solari Calendar is the primary campaign calendar and uses IOG (Ip Osurbaiko Gumdit) and BOG (Bri Osurbaiko Gumdit) dating. Year 0 is the year Solaum was founded by the Solari.
