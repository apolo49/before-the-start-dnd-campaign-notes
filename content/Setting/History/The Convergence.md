Date: [[3800 BOG]]

The Convergence was a major historical disaster that took place on 3800 BOG (0 [[Aeia Foundation Calendar|AFC]], by definition) at [[Mount Aemi]], destroying most magical life on the planet, and various human cultures.

It was thought at the time to be the judgement of the then present [[Solari Religion|gods]], however it took place because the effect is echoed throughout history (both past and future) due to the collision of the elements in 700 [[Dating|IOG]] (5000 AFC). Before, and after, the event the planet was calm and peaceful. During The Convergence many magical creatures were driven insane by the amount of power displayed by The Convergence. The event introduced [[Elements|elements]] into the world in the form of [[Elemental Remnants|elemental remnants]] and [[Elementals|elementals]] (people with the power of the elements). The [[Aeia]] took these elements and placed them in obelisks all over the world (such as the [[Obelisk of Origin]], which houses the [[Power Element|element of power]]).

The effects of the event can be seen throughout the land with the lack of elves, dwarves, tieflings and other magical creatures. The Aeia were forever shaped by the event; the first elementals were all from the Aeia culture.

# The World Before The Convergence
Before the Convergence the world was filled with magic and magical creatures who were at peace with the human population of the world. The land was filled with arcane plants and magic spawned into people freely. The gods were also present on the land at this time and [[Spirits|spirits]] were at peace with the land and its inhabitants.

The spirits would guide humans and other sentient races to utilise magic for their own means in harmony with the world, only the Aeia have this [[Overcoming Wild Magic|knowledge]] retained in their scrolls.

Dragons were also much more common and were in harmony with the races of the world, guiding them in the ways of [[Dragon Magic|draconic arcana]]. This magic allowed sentient beings to control dragons and harness their powers.

The strongholds of magical creatures tend to be around [[Spirit Oases|spirit oases]] where magic remains strong as the Convergence didn't affect these places as much.

Humans were already widespread across the world at this point as nomadic hunter-gatherers, it wouldn't be another ~500 years until the invention of writing by the [[Qatha]]. Humans at this time were in harmony with the land and magic, allowing it to flow through them and used it to further their survival and lifestyle. Around the time of The Convergence the first permanent settlements are beginning to form ([[Ebibu]], [[Solaum]], **AEIA SETTLEMENT HERE**).

# The Convergence

At night's peak on the 14th of Hanomi, the gods retreated to the peak of mount Aemi to perform [[The Ascension]]. When performing this ritual, the gods disappeared and a large beam of light of all colours appeared at the top of the mountain and it covered the sky. The beam lasted for 1 hour and then disappeared as quickly as it came.

During this time various beams of light caused creatures to either ascend into the beam or disintegrate.

Creatures became irate and started attacking each other as many gained unnatural powers of the elements. This new magic causes problems with the balance with natural forces in the world as many creatures absorb the shards causing some to die and some to become empowered.

As a result of these new behaviours, the Spirits become angry and start fighting the creatures causing mass devastation. The graveyards of these spirits become spirit oases as their energies are absorbed into the surrounding area.

Human settlements were destroyed by the beam and the stone the [[Qatha Calendar]] was carved into was marked with an elemental shard ([[Electric Element|Electricity]]).
