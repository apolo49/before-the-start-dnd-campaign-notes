Solaum is the capital, and largest city of the [[Solara|Solara Republic]], it is also the largest and richest city in the world at the time of the campaign. It has a population of around 1,000,000 people. It stands at the centre of the [[Vincum Peninsula]]. The city was founded by the [[Solari (Culture)]] exactly 670 years ago at the start of the campaign. In the centre of the city stands a forum wherein the [[Senate of Solara]] lies as well as other major landmarks.

Solaum, being the most important city in the world at this time, exerts massive influence over the rest of Solara in respect to trends, education, military, science, technology, magic and tourism. It is home to the most prestigious schools in the world including the [[Solaum Centre of Sciences]] and the [[Atiri Centre of Magical Excellence]]. It is the single most visited city in the world.

At the time of the campaign, Solaum has the single highest concentration of languages in the world being a multi-ethnic city, yet it is rare to hear another language than [[Solari (Language)|Solari]]. This is because the concentration of native Solari is so dense and other ethnicities are suppressed. It is expected that everyone in the city speaks Solari.

Being the most advanced and developed city in the world at time, Solaum is home to numerous landmarks and important structures, this includes features such as:
- [[Forum Solaunao]]
- [[Latino Amphitheater]]
- [[Tutino Colosseum]]

# History
## Founding
Solaum, though an old city, is one of the more recent cities to be founded in the world being only 670 years old at the campaign start. The oldest surviving structure in the city is the Obelisk of Origin and was built by [[Aeia]] people before the gradual displacement by the Solari people.

Solaum was built over the [[Atri River]], one side of the river was inhabited by the Aeia, the other side had another settlement by a since extinct group (the [[Bon]]) called "Sol". After [[The Convergence]] and the extinction of the Bon, the Aeia built the Obelisk of Origin containing a shard of the energy of The Convergence which spawned the [[Elements/Power|Power Element]] in the world. Once the Aeia gained this element they wiped themselves out from the site of Solaum.

In the year 0 IOG, the Solari people moved in and settled the area. They attempted to destroy the Obelisk of Origin, but in doing so they ended up harming themselves and the surrounding area.

Solaum was an entirely unremarkable city and developed slowly by trading with surrounding people and other Aeia offshoots including the surrounding [[Vincum]] and [[Khalgal]] peoples who share a common ancestor culture with the Solari.
## Monarchy
*Main Overview: [[Monarchy of Solara]]*
Solaum and Solara weren't always republics, instead, initially they were monarchies. This was a period of 240 years where a singular ruler "Arksi" was in command with a body of advisors that later developed into the Senate of Solara. However it should be noted that the Monarchy was not hereditary but instead was an elected position (for life) by the advisory body. This role later evolved into two roles: [[Brili Shanmi|The Brili Shanmi]] and [[Arksi Shilo|The Arksi Shilo]]. It was required that the Monarch was of either Vincum descent or Solari descent.

Over this time many practices of the religion were established especially by the second king, [[Puli Numini]] and during this period the city saw rapid expansion to over 20,000 inhabitants. He also facilitated trade with the various peoples across the [[Itami Sea]].

In 241 IOG the final king of Solara, [[Fastui Buni Linoki]], was overthrown by the Solari people. They then proceeded to establish the Republic of Solara. Despite this he made massive infrastructure improvements including new walls and an extensive catacombs in the city.
## Republic
Main Overview: [[Solara]]
From the [[5th Century IOG]] Solaum and the Solari Republic began expanding rapidly through conquests of the surrounding peoples especially the [[Vincum]], [[Bigente]], [[Khalgal]], [[Rine]], and [[Esanis]] peoples. Through their invasion of the [[Confluen]] tribes they entered a struggle against the [[Raru]], primarily the [[Yaf]] who owned most of the lands in the [[Moli Ikozinao]].

The [[6th Century IOG]] saw Solaum and the Solari Republic expand eastwards conquering groups such as the [[Margos]], [[Smyrtega]], [[Thes]], [[Kastias]], [[Nanekion]], [[Durum]], [[Inalelea]], [[Naucra]], [[Smyrmaras]], [[Ephe]], [[Juktas]], [[Itami]] and [[Aeia]]. The conquering of the [[Itami]] saw the acquisition of [[Mount Aemi]] a major religious holy site, said to be the home of [[Solari Religion|the gods]]. Additionally economic struggles across the conquered lands saw mass-migration in to the city in hopes of a better life. The continuous warfare saw the creation of a professional army and the first [[Rikati]]. This era brought much prosperity to the city.

The [[7th Century IOG]] (the last 90 years) saw massive unrest as the persecution of [[Elementals|elementals]] began. The Solari Consul, [[Rai Puli Ozi]], oversaw the extermination of 20,000 inhabitants of the city (which had a population of just over 800,000 people) all of whom he proclaimed were elementals. The edict also applied across the republic resulting in millions of deaths.

In the campaigns present day the strength of the city is waning and the people are growing tired of the rampant political corruption. The current consul is out waging unjust wars against the northern [[Dulegan]] descended peoples in the name of "defence against [[The Elements|the elements]]." He has been in power much longer than the original term length because of his extended absence. It is expected he should relinquish his power upon return.
# Geography
## Topography
The area of Solaum proper, the area inside the Walls Rivino encompasses an land area of 14 km<sup>2</sup>. The area outside the walls brings this to over 20 km<sup>2</sup>. This area accounts for around 1,000,000 people at the time of the start of the campaign, meaning a population density of around 71,420 people per square kilometre or ~50,000 people per square kilometre accounting for the larger area.

Solaum sits on the Atri River, this is a navigable river that leads to [[Condobonia]], the second most important city in the republic, and then into the [[Moli Aurirorinao]]. This provides access to eastern lands and has an inland river passing through into the [[Moli Aeianao]].
## Parks and Gardens
The land area of Solaum is littered with public gardens and parks for recreational time, this is because of the numerous villas within and surrounding the city owned by the rich and thriving aristocracy. The Buno Circus is also home to massive garden as well as the Latino Baths.

## Languages
Within Solaum various languages are spoken, over 20 in fact! Though it is expected all people are able to speak [[Solari (Language)]] as it is the standard language of communication among the common-folk. Within the campaign, as the players cannot speak Solari, the Solari people will treat the players as uneducated, backwards foreigners until they are taught the language at the [[College Solamaiko]].

Within richer, more affluent communities (such as those in government), at this point in history it is expected they speak [[Aeikas]] (the language of the Aeia). This is because of Aeia's historical role in the region and throughout the region where it has been used as a lingua franca to facilitate trade and diplomacy. Despite this Solari is gaining traction in government and inter-country relations as Solara is expanding and exerting its influence.

Aeikas will only be used in the campaign when it is appropriate. As the campaign progresses and our heroes work their ways in to more affluent and prestigious areas, the language will become more common.
## Religion
*Main Article: [[Solari Religion]]*
Religion is extremely important in Solaum, with it being a holy city for the Solari religion and a historical centre of pilgrimage as it was important during The Convergence though this knowledge has been lost to time. This religion is shared across most of the Vincum peninsula it is the base of the Arksi Shilo and the [[Bunditi Makosa]].

The most sacred god in Solaum is the goddess Solaum, the goddess of the city. This does not mean the other gods are not revered to a near equal level in the city especially the King and Queen of the pantheon, Sumi and Shunmi. There are several underground mystery cults in the city including the cult of [[Mikri]]. 
# Economy
## Industry
Solaum has a massive industrial complex consisting of Iron and Steel Works as well as construction and other industries. This sort of practice is mostly made up of small independent workshops. Military workshops are sponsored by the state.

A popular food industry is the fermentation of local fish to make fermented fish sauce. This is commonly used as a condiment on local dishes to impart more flavour.

Mining and quarrying are not practiced within the city, but are instead practiced in other areas. This kind of work is seen as lesser and most stones, metals and minerals are imported into the city by land or sea.
## Business
Within Solaum, chain businesses are not overly popular nor prevalent. Most businesses are local businesses worked and owned by local people. It is common that other people are seen as lesser and are less likely to be hired to work these businesses. Work discrimination is rife, especially is someone is of a race other than human, for obvious reasons.
## Tourism
Tourism is popular to Solaum, albeit expensive. This common practice was carried out for both business and leisure. People commuted to Solaum with the expectation to find work, but due to discrimination commonly ended up homeless on the streets. This was not commonly faced by educational tourists, however.

Leisure tourists were generally richer and faced better luck. It is common for leisure tourists to look for culture to admire.
# Education
*Main Article: [[Education in Solara]]*
Education is free for all in Solara and it is expected all children get education full time from 8 to 12 years of age. Solara has a total of 1000 schools for children and a total of 30 schools for adults (universities).
## Schools
### Atiri Centre of Magical Excellence
*Main Article: [[Atiri Centre of Magical Excellence]]*
The Atiri Centre of Magical Excellence was founded by an old philosopher in the year 416 IOG called [[Atiri]] (meaning wise man). He had a great amount of [[Mana|mana]] and was an incredible mage. He was taught by a great [[Aeia]] elf out by [[Mount Aemi]]. He would found the magic school to pass on his original works, but there are many fake grimoires attributed to his name.

The school itself is believed to be the premier magic school in the world and attracts many mages from across the lands. Despite its history it tends to only allow Human students, though will allow students of other races under exceptional circumstance.

The Atiri Centre of Magical Excellence is home to over 1000 mages and spellcasters with dorm rooms for all of them. It has a large underground complex as well as classrooms specialising in different subjects and courses.
### Shuno Gladiatorial Sakin
*Main Article: [[Shuno Gladiatorial Sakini]]*
The Shuno Gladiatorial School is an arena where gladiators and other fighters are tutored to become better fighters. It is owned by the founder of the school: [[Shuni]]; an old soldier of Solara who fought for the 12th [[Rikati]]. He claims to be a big deal soldier, but has never fought a day in his life, he never saw combat and retired late. He was however a professional standing army soldier.

The Shuno Gladiatorial School stands near one of the more popular arenas and is held in high esteem, due to the rumours surrounding Shuni and due to the popular events it puts on between the students that attend it. In the past 20 years of its existence it has produced many great fighters. Some even go on to found their own schools.

It takes the layout of a basic arena with a surrounding amphitheatre.
### Sakini Solamaiko
*Main Article: [[Sakini Solamaiko]]*
The Sakini Solmaiko (Literally "School of Solari") is the place for foreigners to become less foreign by learning the language. It is located nearby the Atiri Centre of Magical Excellence Culture and it is expected that upon immigrating to the city that all foreigners learn the language there or at least take some resources.

As the lingua franca of the world at this point is Solari it is expected that most people will be able to communicate using Solari.

Within here, the players will be handed a book they can fill in with any words they recognise and a book to teach them basic Solari, including the alphabet.
