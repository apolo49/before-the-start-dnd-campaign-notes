The __Kararunena__ (sg. __kararuneme__) are a major part of the [[Qatha Religion]]. They are great demons of the [[Underworld|underworld]] working for the underworld gods. They were a major driving force for forcing the gods away from the world during [[The Convergence]].

# Role in Mythology
__Kararunena__ demons hauled victims to the underworld, some prematurely, some because they had died. This ritual almost seemed random until the [[Qatha]] started to appease the __Kararunena__ through animal sacrifice which fed the __Kararunena__ and quenched their hunger.

They are one of the seven [[Offsprings of the Underworld|offsprings of the underworld]] of the world.

It is said in old texts that:
> They know no food nor drink.
> They eat no flour, no bread nor drink no wine or libation.
> They never know the pleasures of love, marriage, embrace;
> never had a child to hug, kiss or laugh.
> They snatch the child from the knee of the mother;
> They take the bride from the hands of the groom
> and make them disappear from their families home.
> Not a trace of struggle found, but cries roar through the streets.
