Ebibu is an Eastern Language spoken by the peoples of the [[Qatha]] culture and their existing descendants ([[Warmo]], [[Tise]], [[Akshan]], [[Sigenos]]). The original speakers were around [[Pre-Convergence Cultures|Before the Convergence]] as such the language is considered to be one of the oldest in existence and has many archaisms that may shed light upon the original peoples and the world they lived in.

Ebibu is named after the city of [[Ebbu]] an important city to the Southeast of [[Solaum]] in the [[Qatha Sandlands]]. Ebbu was a major centre of civilisation and is considered by the Qatha Culture as their original homeland. It is written using the Ebibu Script, a syllabary used only by this language, it used to be adopted by other languages, but then fell out of favour. In the [[Ebbu Grand Library]] there is a [[Tablet of Ebilari|tablet]] that can be used to transliterate Ebibu, Solari and Latin Characters between each other.

Ebibu was once the lingua franca of the Qatha Sandlands. It has slowly declined in influence after the fall of the [[Nepululma Empire]] which spanned the area. It was the official language of many empires before this though including the [[Ebbu Empire]], [[Nibi Empire]], [[Urkesh Empire]], and the [[Suhania]]. It is still the language of many modern states and a second language in the [[Eceh]] Empire.

# History and Writing
## Writing
Ebibu is written using the Ebibu Syllabary, a script that was not invented by the Qatha peoples, but instead by a far off land that has since lost contact. It bears resemblance to old elven writing systems found in the far East.

Historically it is written on the leaves of the now-extinct Tusari Palm, but a close relative of the plant has since been found and is heavily farmed in [[Al-Tusaria]] and its capital [[Ebbu]].

# Grammar
## Morphology
### Consonantal Root
Most roots of the Ebibu language consist of 3 consonants, called radicals. Between these radicals various infixes, suffixes and prefixes are inserted to impose grammatical and word-generating functions. The resulting consonant-vowel pattern differentiates the meaning of the root.

### Case, Number, Gender
Ebibu has two numbers, *singular* and *plural* and three cases *nominative*, *accusative*, and *genitive*, though in plural accusative and genitive collapse into a single *oblique* case.

Plurals are only differentiated by sound. This happens by tacking on a plural ending to the noun in the sentence.

The following table will demonstrate this concept in the Latin alphabet

|          |            | Noun      |              | Adjective |              |
| -------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------ |
| Number   | Case       | masc.     | fem.         | masc.     | fem.         |
| Singular | Nominative | sararu-mu | sararu-ta-mu | dananu-mu | dananu-ta-mu |
|          | Genitive   | sararu-mi | sararu-ta-mi | dananu-mi | dananu-ta-mi |
|          | Accusative | sararu-ma | sararu-ta-ma | dananu-ma | dananu-ta-ma |
| Plural   | Nominative | sararu-na | sararu-ta-na | dananu-na | dananu-ta-na |
|          | Oblique    | sararu-ni | sararu-ta-ni | dananu-ni | dananu-ta-ni |

## The Elements
The elements can be referred to in two ways in __Ebibu__. As the Qatha were a sceptical people, they preferred to use euphemisms rather than use their literal names as to not incur the wrath of the elementals. These euphemisms were to refer to the lands and winds around the Qatha homeland. The names of the elements are:

| Element                               | Literal Name (unused) | Euphemism   | Meaning               |
